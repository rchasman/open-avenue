open-avenue
===========

Open Avenue is a web app made on Meteor where on a constantly under development 65,536 km avenue anyone can create a branching street to their personal, shareable, addressed web-grotto.

#Outline

* Protype with canvas, proccesing, or d3.js
    * Hoping to eventually move to webgl, but don't know know the technical
  limitations for scalable webgl over sockets.
* Async view of currently rendered segments of the road.
* Address generated via the location int that is picked as the seed.
    * You can share this with your friends so that they can visit your place.
* This is an open free-market experiment, if people want to advertise, draw
  dicks, etc they can.
* Will people be able to modify other peoples places? Could get out of hand.
    * Maybe an upvote downvote/flagging system of sorts that doesn't compromise
        the open and free-market nature of the system.
    * Don't know yet how I'm going to allow for policing of things.
* Will there be some sort of currency to earn or limitation to the ammount of
  'building materials' users have immediate access to? Maybe to encourage
  exploration they have to earn them somehow?

##Disclaimer

All of this is just me brainstorming, is completely subject to change, to be
abandoned, or turn into something totally awesome.

##First Steps

* Set up basic page with a user system.
* Set up graphics library and give users ability to create basic shapes
  associated with their accounts.
* Allow users to allocate space on the first iteration of the main 'Avenue' to
  branch their own street off of.
